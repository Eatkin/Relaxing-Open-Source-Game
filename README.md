# Relaxing-Open-Source-Game
 
Source code for "A Relaxing Typing Game" but with all the assets I don't have the rights to distribute stripped out. Everything included is either made by me or public domain (or in the case of the music my friend made it and won't care üëç)

Feel free to do what you want with this project, however my one condition is that you do not put this game or variations on it up for sale. You can make mods and changes and release them for free if you want, that's cool.
